# Ruby Algorithm Practice

## Base Number Converter

### Challenge:

Write an algorithm that will take...
- a number
- the alphabet / number system that number belongs to
- the alphabet / number system you would like to see that number converted to

And return...
- the number converted to the new alphabet / number system of a different base

Program should be able to handle the following base number systems.

bin = '01'
oct      = '01234567'
dec      = '0123456789'
hex      = '0123456789abcdef'
allow    = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
allup    = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
alpha    = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
alphanum = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
